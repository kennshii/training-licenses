# Training Licenses
Project in which I worked as a Java Engineer during the internship. A RestAPI intended for handling calls coming from the frontend.

The project is built on the basis of Hexagonal Architecture.

Implemented containerization in Docker. You can see the configurations in the Dockerfile.

Fully tested with Unit Tests using the JUnit5 framework. Integration tests are based on Cucumber. Archunit tests were also implemented that control the violation of the project architecture.
